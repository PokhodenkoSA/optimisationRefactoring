DEFINE_STANDARD_HANDLE(Geom_BezierCurve, Geom_BoundedCurve)

//! Describes a rational or non-rational Bezier curve
//! - a non-rational Bezier curve is defined by a table of
//! poles (also called control points),
//! - a rational Bezier curve is defined by a table of
//! poles with varying weights.
//! These data are manipulated by two parallel arrays:
//! - the poles table, which is an array of gp_Pnt points, and
//! - the weights table, which is an array of reals.
//! The bounds of these arrays are 1 and "the number of "poles" of the curve.
//! The poles of the curve are "control points" used to deform the curve.
//! The first pole is the start point of the curve, and the
//! last pole is the end point of the curve. The segment
//! that joins the first pole to the second pole is the
//! tangent to the curve at its start point, and the
//! segment that joins the last pole to the
//! second-from-last pole is the tangent to the curve at its end point.
//! It is more difficult to give a geometric signification to
//! the weights but they are useful for providing the exact
//! representations of arcs of a circle or ellipse.
//! Moreover, if the weights of all poles are equal, the
//! curve is polynomial; it is therefore a non-rational
//! curve. The non-rational curve is a special and
//! frequently used case. The weights are defined and
//! used only in the case of a rational curve.
//! The degree of a Bezier curve is equal to the number
//! of poles, minus 1. It must be greater than or equal to
//! 1. However, the degree of a Geom_BezierCurve
//! curve is limited to a value (25) which is defined and
//! controlled by the system. This value is returned by the function MaxDegree.
//! The parameter range for a Bezier curve is [ 0, 1 ].
//! If the first and last control points of the Bezier curve
//! are the same point then the curve is closed. For
//! example, to create a closed Bezier curve with four
//! control points, you have to give the set of control
//! points P1, P2, P3 and P1.
//! The continuity of a Bezier curve is infinite.
//! It is not possible to build a Bezier curve with negative
//! weights. We consider that a weight value is zero if it
//! is less than or equal to gp::Resolution(). We
//! also consider that two weight values W1 and W2 are equal if:
//! |W2 - W1| <= gp::Resolution().
//! Warning
//! - When considering the continuity of a closed Bezier
//! curve at the junction point, remember that a curve
//! of this type is never periodic. This means that the
//! derivatives for the parameter u = 0 have no
//! reason to be the same as the derivatives for the
//! parameter u = 1 even if the curve is closed.
//! - The length of a Bezier curve can be null.
